# Blender 4 Donut

This repository contains all the files I created while following [Andrew Price's Blender donut tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z).

## Notes

### Physical Based Rendering

In [Part 5 - Shading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsLO1F5x7yM&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=5), Andrew mentioned that the process he showed to add the quartzite texture to the plane was an example of creating a Physical Based Rendering (PBR) shader.
